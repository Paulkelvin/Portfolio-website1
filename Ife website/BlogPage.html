      <h2 class="subtitle1">Utility Adds Value to Your NFTs</h2>
      <p class="blog--paragraph1 paragraph">
        The fact that NFTs offer more flexibility and utility than other digital
        assets is one of the primary reasons they are growing in popularity.
      </p>
      <p class="blog--paragraph2 paragraph">
        So what if you want to begin an NFT project? The success of your NFT
        project will depend on a variety of things. Your NFT would need to have
        utility such that collectors would want to be a part of the community in
        order to gain long-term value.
      </p>
      <p class="blog--paragraph3 paragraph">
        Today's most well-liked NFT projects include a strong emphasis on
        utility because many collectors desire the added value it provides as
        well as opportunities to communicate with the creators.
      </p>
      <p class="blog--paragraph4 paragraph">
        So, how can you, as a creator, provide your NFT customers with this kind
        of value and utility? Read along as you find the answers to this, but
        firstly, let’s find what utility in NFT really means.
      </p>
      <h2 class="subtitle2">What is an NFT Utility?</h2>
      <p class="blog--paragraph5 paragraph">
        NFT Utility or Utility NFTs are NFTs with underlying valuable and
        real-world applications. The word “NFT utility” is mostly used to mean
        the “real-world use case of an NFT”. It is, to put it simply, how NFTs
        can be used in our everyday life. Depending on the opportunities and
        access they offer NFT holders or collectors, utility NFTs are regarded
        as valuable.
      </p>
      <p class="blog--paragraph6 paragraph">
        The NFT utility's developer offers customers exclusive benefits
        including memberships, service access, access to actual events, digital
        assets, or physical goods. Numerous NFT initiatives improve the daily
        life of their owners.
      </p>

      <h2 class="subtitle3">NFT Utility will be Huge and Here is Why</h2>
      <p class="blog--paragraph7 paragraph">
        We’re already seeing plenty of developments in how utility NFTs are
        built and deployed - and this looks set to continue. For instance, while
        some astute sports organisations already use NFTs to replace paper
        tickets for important games, there's no reason why NFTs can't someday
        replace season tickets, providing year-round access to club games.
      </p>
      <h2 class="subtitle3">NFT Utility will be Huge and Here is Why</h2>
      <p class="blog--paragraph8 paragraph">
        Any asset would be able to be presented on the blockchain with the
        arrival of cutting-edge tokenization technology. This technology's
        tokens can be used to build decentralised marketplaces, which has the
        potential to upend many sectors and open up new markets in previously
        underserved regions. Digital arts and the real estate sector are two
        examples of these.
      </p>
      <p class="blog--paragraph9 paragraph">
        NFTs can be purchased and sold by anyone with an internet connection,
        unlike physical art, which can only be purchased and sold by authorised
        parties. In this approach, digital artists can market their products to
        customers directly without the need for galleries or other middlemen.
      </p>
      <p class="blog--paragraph10 paragraph">
        In the upcoming years, NFTs will upend numerous industries, and they
        will quickly dominate the digital environment.
      </p>
      <p class="blog--paragraph11 paragraph">
        The use of NFT utility will significantly alter how we purchase, sell,
        and exchange goods both online and off. Our current digital environment
        will undergo a transformation when they are introduced alongside
        blockchain technology.
      </p>
      <h2 class="subtitle4">Quality ways to Add utility to your NFT Project</h2>
      <p class="blog--paragraph12 paragraph">
        The list is far from exhaustive. To provide you a broad overview of
        several NFT utility ideas, we will simply briefly describe a few great
        utility NFT types.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="list--subtitle1 list--subtitle">Make your NFT Redeemable</li>
        <p class="list--paragraph1 list--paragraph">
          The concept behind a redeemable NFT is that its owner can trade it in
          for a real or digital asset, such as specialized goods. For instance,
          Fewocious, a crypto artist, and brand RTFKT, a prominent producer of
          digital shoes and collectibles, collaborated to create a line of
          digital sneakers. In their NFT project, holders of particular NFTs
          might exchange them for a real pair of shoes. The three utility NFTs
          each represented a distinct set of actual footwear.
        </p>
        <li class="list--subtitle2 list--subtitle">
          Connect NFTs to the Real World
        </li>
        <p class="list--paragraph2 list--paragraph">
          Discover a need in the actual world, and then figure out how to
          incorporate it into the NFT environment. You can look for areas in the
          actual world where you can use your NFT to create value that your
          holders will appreciate.
        </p>
        <p class="list--paragraph3 list--paragraph">
          Any business, whether it be an artist, a startup, or a well-known
          fashion label, can benefit from this kind of utility. The following
          are some advantages your audience may experience from your NFT drops:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Tickets for virtual/real concerts or fashion events — a great option
            for artists, agencies, or fashion houses to expand their reach and
            promote their brand.
          </li>
          <li>
            Entrance to tech conferences — a way for corporations to make geeky
            events a bit more fun.
          </li>

            Entrance to tech conferences — a way for corporations to make geeky

          </li>
          <li>
            Early access to projects on the brim of launch — to make your
            audience feel privileged, to spread the word, and ignite interest.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li class="list--subtitle3 list--subtitle">
          Make your NFT usable in the Metaverse
        </li>
        <p class="list--paragraph4 list--paragraph">
          One of the leading companies to launch the NFT dive into the Metaverse
          was Nike. The company's CryptoKicks, footwear to wear in the
          Metaverse, were patented in 2019. Some of the models from the series
          sold for over $130,000 in 2022 after it was released in 2021.
        </p>
        <p class="list--paragraph5 list--paragraph">
          All of this was made feasible by Nike's acquisition of RTFKT, a
          business that had previously produced NFTs for redeeming sneakers.
        </p>
        <p class="list--paragraph6 list--paragraph">
          Wearables are just one aspect of the expanding market for Metaverse
          utility NFTs. These days, it's even possible to buy property in the
          Metaverse, also, In-game items can be purchased.
        </p>
        <li class="list--subtitle4 list--subtitle">Offer a DAO service</li>
        <p class="list--paragraph7 list--paragraph">
          Certain NFT holders get the benefit of voting to decide an aspect of a
          decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Holders may be given the
          opportunity to vote on upcoming community projects and manage the
          treasury. They can decide whether to raise fees, give to
          organizations, launch new proposals, make investments, and more. In
          recent years, DAOs have grown big among collectors as they prefer the
          community to have some input on their investment.
        </p>
        <p class="list--paragraph8 list--paragraph">
          Also, charities and non-profits can provide an NFT as a prize for
          raising a certain amount of money for a charity cause instead of
          providing a free t-shirt or entry into a raffle. T-shirts lose value
          after they are worn, but owning an NFT is like owning an investment,
          and its value can increase over time, thus this would probably be a
          more alluring award and could inspire individuals to raise capital
          more.
        </p>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="subtitle5 subtitle">Other Gerat NFT ideas for creators</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Turn Your Music into NFTs</li>

        <li>Use NFTs for supply chain tracking. Link physical goods to NFTs</li>

      </ul>
      <h2 class="subtitle6 subtitle">Concluding Thoughts</h2>
      <p class="blog--paragraph13 paragraph">
        NFT utilities are beneficial and may even make your project stand out
        from the competition. The buyer you're looking for may be attracted by a
        well-designed roadmap and eye-catching utilities.
      </p>
      <p class="blog--paragraph14 paragraph">
        <a href="">IncubateX</a> thinks it's accurate to state that utilities
        are the future of NFTs, and that it's the real-world value that will
        transform the sector from a passing fad into one that is profitable,
        sustainable, and attracts ongoing investment. The good thing is that
        there are a ton of use cases to get ideas from.
      </p>
      <p class="blog--paragraph15 paragraph">
        The majority of the projects in the bear market are NFTs with no
        practical applications. Your NFTs should be usable in the actual world
        if you want to produce an NFT project that stands the test of time.

      <p class="blog--paragraph1 paragraph">
        It all starts with a raw plan! You were probably in the bathroom or
        taking your pet dog for a walk, or wherever the case may be when you
        first conceived this great Web3 idea. Moving on, you started to nurture
        the idea, beautify it, reevaluate it, and then proceed to design a
        business plan for it.
      </p>
      <p class="blog--paragraph2 paragraph">
        Now, you have done a great job, it is all appealing and makes perfect
        sense to you, but here are key questions: do you think others will find
        it as appealing as you do? More importantly, how do you plan to pitch
        your startup idea to stand out of the several thousands of ideas that
        there are? Investors only get to select a few Web3 projects, could you
        be confident of making the list?
      </p>
      <p class="blog--paragraph3 paragraph">
        Thing is, pitching your startup idea to investors is one of the most
        crucial steps to take if you want your project to have a headway. So
        many have seen their great ideas fail before it even started just
        because of terrible pitching. And on the flip side, some “just OK” ideas
        have seen investment support and incredible success due to high
        captivating pitches.
      </p>
      <p class="blog--paragraph4 paragraph">
        This is the reality of startup pitching. So, this is why you need to
        present an impressive startup pitch if you want to convince investors to
        support your project.

          First and foremost, it's crucial to do your homework on the experience
          and background of potential investors before going to present your
          ideas to them. They might be drawn to a project that aims to achieve a
          certain objective, a particular division of a business at a particular
          stage of development, etc. You can use this information to better
          understand the investors' needs and what you should provide them to

          Another crucial component of any startup presentation is a description
          of your competitive advantages. You must provide evidence and
          justification for why your products are superior to those offered by
          competitors.

          Also, charities and non-profits can provide an NFT as a prize for
          raising a certain amount of money for a charity cause instead of
          providing a free t-shirt or entry into a raffle. T-shirts lose value
          after they are worn, but owning an NFT is like owning an investment,
          and its value can increase over time, thus this would probably be a
          more alluring award and could inspire individuals to raise capital
          more.

        <li class="list--subtitle">Customer acquisition</li>
        <p class="list--paragraph">
          Your customer acquisition expenses can be easily calculated from your
          finances. So it's best to be specific when describing to investors how
          you'll draw in new clients, the medium you'll use for advertising, and
          any other techniques you'll employ. To give potential investors a
          clear picture of who your clients will be, conduct consumer research
          and develop a client profile.

        <p class="list--paragraph">
          Never say that you need “a million dollars or maybe a million and a
          half.” That is a pretty huge difference. The investor will assume that
          you don't know exactly how much money you need if you don't provide
          any hard numbers.
        </p>
        <p class="list--paragraph">
          As a result, it's crucial to know exactly how much money you need to
          achieve your goals. By doing this, you demonstrate that you have
          goals, are capable of achieving them, and will not take the investor's
          money for granted.

        NFT utilities are beneficial and may even make your project stand out
        from the competition. The buyer you're looking for may be attracted by a
        well-designed roadmap and eye-catching utilities.
      </p>
      <p class="blog--paragraph14 paragraph">
        <a href="">IncubateX</a> thinks it's accurate to state that utilities
        are the future of NFTs, and that it's the real-world value that will
        transform the sector from a passing fad into one that is profitable,
        sustainable, and attracts ongoing investment. The good thing is that
        there are a ton of use cases to get ideas from.

      <p class="blog--paragraph15 paragraph">
        The majority of the projects in the bear market are NFTs with no
        practical applications. Your NFTs should be usable in the actual world
        if you want to produce an NFT project that stands the test of time.
